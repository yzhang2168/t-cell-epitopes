This repo contains the source code used in the paper entitled `Targets and cross-reactivity of human T cell recognition of Common Cold Coronaviruses`.

All APIs needed to identify peptides conserved at the amino acid sequence level across different taxonomic groups, given a list of known epitope sequences are in:
`find_kmer.py`

An example workflow is included in `main` of `find_kmer.py`.
